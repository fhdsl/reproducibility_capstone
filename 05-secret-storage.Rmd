```

## Phase 1: Understanding GitHub Secrets

### Step 1: What Are GitHub Secrets?
- GitHub Secrets are encrypted environment variables stored securely in your repository
- They allow you to store sensitive information (like API keys, tokens, passwords) without exposing them in your code
- Secrets are only accessible to GitHub Actions during workflow runs and appear as `*` in logs
- This assignment teaches you a fundamental skill for secure automation in research environments

### Step 2: Why Personal Access Tokens Matter
- Personal Access Tokens (PATs) provide secure authentication for GitHub Actions
- They allow automated workflows to perform actions that require permissions (like creating issues, pushing to repositories, etc.)
- In research contexts, PATs enable automated data sharing, publication workflows, and collaborative tools
- Important: PATs should be treated like passwords - never share them publicly

## Phase 2: Creating Your Personal Access Token

### Step 3: Navigate to GitHub Token Settings
1. Go to your GitHub profile (click your profile picture in the top right)
2. Click "Settings" from the dropdown menu (you will see a gear icon `r config::get("settings")`)
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" in the left sidebar (at the bottom)
4. Click "Personal access tokens"
5. Select "Tokens (classic)" from the submenu

```
Navigation path: Profile → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
```

### Step 4: Generate New Token
1. Click "Generate new token" 
2. Select "Generate new token (classic)"
3. GitHub may ask for your password - enter it to continue
4. You'll be taken to the token creation page

### Step 5: Configure Your Token
1. Add a descriptive note: 
   - Use something like "Capstone Assignment 3 - Secret Storage"
   - This helps you remember what this token is for later

2. Set expiration:
   - For this assignment, you can set it to 30 days or custom
   - In real research, consider the security vs. convenience trade-off

3. Select scopes (permissions):
   - Check "repo" - this gives full repository access
   - For this assignment, "repo" scope is sufficient
   - In production, use the minimum required permissions

```

```

### Step 6: Generate and Copy Token
1. Scroll to bottom and click "Generate token"
2. CRITICAL: Copy the token immediately - GitHub will only show it once (perhaps keep the window open as you copy it)
3. The token will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

⚠️ Warning: If you navigate away without copying the token, you'll need to create a new one!

## Phase 3: Storing the Secret in Your Repository

### Step 7: Navigate to Repository Settings
1. Go to your capstone sandbox repository (not your personal settings)
2. Click the "Settings" tab at the top of the repository page
3. In the left sidebar, find "Secrets and variables"
4. Click "Actions" under "Secrets and variables"

```
Repository navigation: Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
```

### Step 8: Create New Repository Secret
1. Click "New repository secret" (green button)
2. Enter the secret details:
   - Name: `ASSIGNMENT_SECRET` 
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must be exactly this name - case sensitive!
   - Secret: Paste your personal access token from Step 6
3. Click "Add secret"

### Step 9: Verify Secret Creation
- You should see `ASSIGNMENT_SECRET` listed in your repository secrets
- The value will show as "Updated X seconds ago" but won't display the actual token
- If you need to update it, click the secret name and choose "Update"

## Phase 4: Testing Your Secret

### Step 10: Trigger the Evaluation Action
1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Look for "GitHub Secret Evaluation" in the workflows list on the left
3. Click on "GitHub Secret Evaluation"
4. Click the "Run workflow" button (you may need to select branch "main")
5. Click "Run workflow" again to confirm

```

```

### Step 11: Monitor the Evaluation
1. Watch for the workflow to start running (you'll see a yellow circle, then green check mark or red X)
2. The evaluation will take a few moments to check if your secret exists and is valid
3. Don't worry if it takes a minute - the system needs to verify everything is configured correctly

### Step 12: Check the Results
1. Navigate to the "Issues" tab in your repository
2. Look for a new issue created by the evaluation system
3. The issue title will indicate success or failure of your secret storage
4. Click on the issue to see detailed results

## Phase 5: Retrieving Your Validation Code

### Step 13: Success Scenario
If your secret was stored correctly:
- The issue will contain a validation code
- Copy the entire validation code (it will be clearly marked)
- Keep this code safe - you'll need it for your Coursera quiz

### Step 14: Failure Scenarios and Troubleshooting

#### Secret Not Found:
- Check the secret name: Must be exactly `ASSIGNMENT_SECRET`
- Verify location: Must be in repository secrets, not personal settings
- Re-create if needed: Delete and recreate the secret with correct name

### Step 15: Re-running Evaluation
If you need to fix issues and re-test:
1. Make necessary corrections (recreate secret, new token, etc.)
2. Return to Actions tab
3. Run the "GitHub Secret Evaluation" workflow again
4. Check for a new issue with updated results

## Phase 6: Completing the Assignment

### Step 16: Submit Your Quiz
1. Navigate to your Coursera Capstone Quiz
2. Find the Assignment 3 question
3. Paste your validation code exactly as provided in the issue
4. Submit the quiz to receive credit

### Step 17: Clean Up (Optional but Recommended)
After completing the assignment:
1. Consider revoking the PAT if you don't plan to use it further
2. Delete the secret if it's no longer needed
3. Document what you learned about secret management

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

### Token Management
- Use descriptive names for tokens to track their purpose
- Set appropriate expiration dates - shorter is more secure
- Regularly audit and rotate tokens in production environments
- Revoke unused tokens to minimize security exposure

### Secret Storage Best Practices
- Use specific, descriptive names for secrets
- Apply principle of least privilege - only grant necessary permissions
- Never log or print secrets in your workflows
- Regularly review who has access to repository secrets

### Research Context Applications
- API keys for data sources (e.g., cancer databases, genomic repositories)
- Authentication for computing clusters or cloud services
- Credentials for automated publication or preprint systems
- Tokens for collaborative tools and notification systems

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Secret not found" Error
Check these items:
- Secret name is exactly: ASSIGNMENT_SECRET
- Secret is stored in your copy of the capstone-sandbox repository settings
- The repository is the correct sandbox repository (not `fhdsl/capstone-sandbox` but instead your own copy)


_The following troubleshooting tips do not apply to the assignment itself but may apply in other scenarios where you are using a similar setup_: 

### "Invalid token" Error
Verify:
- Token was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Token hasn't expired
- Token has 'repo' scope permissions
- Token was generated for the correct GitHub account

What to do to fix: 
- Generate a new PAT: Your token may have expired or been created incorrectly
- Check scopes: Ensure "repo" permission is selected
- Update the secret: Replace the old token with the new one

### Workflow Doesn't Run

Ensure:
- You're triggering from the correct repository
- You're selecting the main branch
- The workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/`
- You have permissions to run workflows

This assignment teaches a crucial skill for modern computational research: secure credential management. 
In real research environments, you'll use these same techniques to store API keys for cancer databases, 
authentication tokens for computing clusters, and credentials for automated research workflows.
The ability to securely manage secrets enables sophisticated automation while maintaining security standards required 
for sensitive cancer research data.
